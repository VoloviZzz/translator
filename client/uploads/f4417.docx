From the complexity of the material, from the ability of the Master to model in the learning element the activities of the student in his study. </p><br><p> In the development of the brochure of the training element, there are: the master of industrial training, the technical expert, the programmer, the illustrator, the expert-methodologist. In the completed version, this document should be didactically literate, executed in accordance with the requirements of modular technology and reflect the appropriate level of professional activity.
